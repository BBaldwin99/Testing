This repo is an example of making and testing a shell script while using git. What is included in this repo is my backup.sh and README.md. The script was made using the nano editor. I did have difficulties figuring out how to use the editor as it was my first time, it took a few tries writing a test script for me to start writing the backup.sh. Comments were added to define what some commands were doing in the script. Source used https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners.
